Traffic Accident Prediction with Decision Trees and SHAP

This project explores the use of Decision Trees for predicting the likelihood of traffic accidents based on various road, weather, and driver-related conditions. In addition to training and evaluating the model, the project focuses on interpretability by integrating SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) to explain individual predictions and highlight feature importance.

The dataset includes features such as weather, road type, time of day, vehicle type, driver age, and experience ‚Äî allowing for a realistic simulation of traffic risk modeling.
